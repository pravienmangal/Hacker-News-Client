## ES6 Hacker News Client

This is a Hacker News Client project to fetch and display top news using the [Hacker News API](https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json) to fetch top stories IDs, https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/'#ID.json to fetch each news data and https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/'#commentID.json to fetch comments of each story. I used the amazing ES6 without using any libraries or frameworks to build this HN Client.
